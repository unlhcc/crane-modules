This is a bundle of phrap, cross_match, and swat.
Phrap is a program for assembling shotgun DNA sequence data. Cross_match is a general purpose utility for comparing any two DNA sequence sets using a 'banded' version of swat. Swat is a program for searching one or more DNA or protein query sequences, or a query profile, against a sequence database, using an efficient implementation of the Smith-Waterman or Needleman-Wunsch algorithms with linear (affine) gap penalties.
